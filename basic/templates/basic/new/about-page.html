                    <p id='starting'>PSK INDUSTRIES started its manufacturing processes in the year 2012. Before 2012 we were a trading firm catering both the domestic customers as well as export houses dealing in all types of garment accessories. Lack of quality production, mismanagement of deliveries and customer services in the industry encouraged us to setup our own manufacturing plant of die casting.

                    <p id='starting'>We continuously strive to be better in our business. We as a team try to contribute to our society as much as we can by developing complicated products that have not yet been made in our markets. Our strategy is to make our country less dependent on imports from China and in order to do that we try to make such complicated products which are not usually made in our domestic market which eventually leads to more employment here in our country and reduce the cash outflows from our country. </p>
